DOM Manipulation with JavaScript project, where element creation and attribute modification is done only using JavaScript.
Basic project timeline:
1.- Creation of html and css boilerplate (basic div creation and styling).
2.- Basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript (creation of element).
3.- Ajusting point 2 to fit the project requirements.
4.- Once ensuring the proper creation of necessary elements, proceeded to work on hover effect.
5.- Spent most time adjusting hover effect to properly recreate desired effect.
